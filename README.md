# Pica40 v2

Split keyboard with 40 keys using XIAO controllers.

_Pica pica - european (common) magpie_

## Features

- 40 keys
- high profile (regular MX switches with hotswap sockets) or low profile (soldered low-profile ChocV2 switches)
- wired/wireless versions
- aggressive stagger
- slightly splayed for pinky columns

### Wired version

- XIAO RP2040 controller
- QMK firmware
- USB-C or TRRS connection between splits
- one rotary encoder (without click)
- status LED

### Wireless version

- XIAO nRF52840 BLE controller
- ZMK firmware
- two rotary encoders (without click, only master side encoder is currently supported by ZMK)
- on/off toggle
- battery connectors

> [!NOTE]
> I created a beta version with small improvements for wireless version - https://github.com/zzeneg/pica40/tree/v2.2-beta?tab=readme-ov-file#v22. I'm fairly confident it should work but I'm not able to verify it at the moment. You can order it at your own risk, let me know if everything worked.

- [Bottom plate](./case/production/bottom.zip)

## Case files (STL - 3d printed, MX hotswap only)

All files are in [stl](./stl) folder.

### Top:

- wired/wireless versions
- with and without encoders
- normal and thin versions (see bottom parts for difference)

### Bottom:

Normal version - solid cover, cutouts for legs.
Thin version - 1.2mm lower than normal version, cutouts for all elements. Has additional cutouts for magnets.

## Build log

**TODO**

## Development

For proper KiCad setup install my [zzkeeb](https://github.com/zzeneg/zzkeeb/blob/main/README.md#installation) library.

## Changelog
